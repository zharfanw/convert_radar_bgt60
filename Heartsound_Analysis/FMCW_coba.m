% Parameters
f_start = 2.4e9; % Start frequency
f_stop = 2.5e9; % Stop frequency
Tm = 1e-3; % Sweep time
c = 3e8; % Speed of light

% Time vector
t = linspace(0, Tm, 1000);

% Generate transmitted signal
f_t = linspace(f_start, f_stop, length(t)); % Frequency sweep
s_t = exp(1i*2*pi*f_t.*t); % Transmitted signal

% Simulate received signal (with delay for example)
tau = 1e-6; % Delay
s_r = exp(1i*2*pi*(f_t.*(t - tau))); % Received signal

% Mixing the signals
mixed_signal = s_t .* conj(s_r);

% Range calculation
R = c * tau / 2;

% Signal processing and detection
